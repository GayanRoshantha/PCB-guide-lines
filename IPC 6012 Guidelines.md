IPC 6012 Guidelines: Classifying, Designing, and Fabricating PCBs
What are IPC 6012 Standards?
At present, the electronics industry is a fast-developing industry, with the current needs of human beings. Because of that many pieces of equipment are upcoming with time, where the PCBs play an important role play. Considering the signal transmission and interconnection of the electronic components Rigid Printed Boards play an important role. Therefore, increasing and maintaining the quality and reliability of these PCBs is an important task in this field. To ensure these factors the electronic experts in this domain developed the IPC standards. IPC 6012 basically explains the performance specification introduced by the IPC (Association Connecting Electronics Industries). Here, there are descriptions of the fabrication and performance of the PCBs. Mainly these standards are possible to divide into three classes. They are as follows:

Class 1 - General Electronic Products
Class 2 - Specialized service electronic products
Class 3 - High-performance electronic devices

# Class 1
Class 1 is for electronic devices where their functionality of them is not critical. Mainly these products include low-power using and low-signal transmission electronics. 
Most of the cases the reliability of these products is not a case that takes into account.

# Class 2
Class 2 is for the electronic products that develop for special case scenarios. Under this class performance and the reliability of the electronic product are highly taken into account. 
These electronic products are with moderate power consumption and moderate signal passing. 
Mainly these electronic products are for continuous working systems.

# Class 3
Class 3 is for electronic equipment that is for high-performance applications. Devices that come under class 3 have high reliability and high performance compared to the other two classes. 
This includes products with high-power or high-speed circuits, so if there is failure can have serious consequences.
